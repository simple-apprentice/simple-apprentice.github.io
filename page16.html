					<p class="text-justify"> During the data collection phase, the dataset consisted of <samp>5000</samp> images with different skin colors, lighting, and backgrounds. It was divided into a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The YOLOv<samp>5</samp> model was used to predict five gestures on the test set. In the case of using the original model, experimental results showed that after <samp>100</samp> rounds of training, the model performance index was <samp>81.1</samp>% precision, <samp>81.4</samp>% recall, and <samp>0.531</samp> MAP.  </p>
                  <p class="text-justify">In terms of algorithm optimization, based on the original YOLOv<samp>5</samp> model, the CBAM attention mechanism, multi-scale detection method, and Gaussian filtering were introduced to enhance the model's efficiency further. After testing on the same test set, the experimental results showed that the model performance indexes were <samp>87.2</samp>% precision, <samp>84.1</samp>% recall, and <samp>0.564</samp> MAP. Through optimization, model accuracy improved by <samp>6.1</samp>%, recall rate increased by <samp>2.7</samp>%, and MAP improved by <samp>3.2</samp>%. Experimental tests showed that the proposed enhanced method was feasible and could accurately recognize five basic gestures.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Finally, the model was deployed on a Raspberry Pi development board and was able to quickly reproduce the human pose with a communication delay of less than 1 ms. </p>
